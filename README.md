# Prject: poc_rag_blv

The project has two main objectives:

1. Implement RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) on data from the Base LÃ©gislative Vaudoise.
2. Evaluate the effectiveness and quality of the RAG implementation by developing and applying metrics to measure the accuracy, relevance, and coherence of the generated outputs. This assessment will help quantify the performance improvements gained through the RAG approach and identify areas for further optimization.
